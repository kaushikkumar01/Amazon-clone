# Amazon-clone
I built an Amazon clone using React.js, React Router, and Tailwind CSS, incorporating fundamental e-commerce functionalities. Users can add items to their shopping cart and review their orders on a dedicated order page. The project leverages React.js for the user interface, React Router for seamless navigation, and Tailwind CSS for  a modern design
